#Agile Development case study

let'say there's a weight loss company and they want an app.They go to an Agile Dev company 
and most probably one of the first questions is how much it would cost to get the app Built.

An agile developer will say something like "we think it will take like three months, cost around $5000 a month
and we are pretty confident we can do it in three months". This is pretty ambiguous and a little stressing to the client. 

The client is probably thinking "we only have an $18000 budget, and we need some kind of quarantee that things 
wont spin out of control"

This ambiguity is alot in Agile and lets say the client takes a leap of faith and the project starts.

The first couple weeks is usually alot of questions, the scrum master/project manager is clarifying the requirements the
developers are doing design. And eeveryone is asking questions about every little details. The client gets alot emails, phone calls, skype chats and just tons of clarification issues.

The client has to be very responsive. Probably after week or two the client gets a realese, might be just a logIn screen or somekind of mininimal feature. **Agile tries to make releases early, faster and as often**. The client then sees alot of releases everyday or week and they start seeing their app come into life. 

Pretty soon the client starts coming up with little ideas to expaund or some kind of minimal change here and there "like could we add some text here, a button here, remove this and change it to this.... and alot of tiny changes".

The developers are not bound and well these changes can take well effectivelly.The developers will give the client the impact of changes.

The projects keep unfolding with time as weeks progress and theres tons of changes and every kind of detailed has been improved in some way. the client sees releases everyday and they are constantly giving feedback. The product comes out much better than actually expected.

 In the case where the client lets say wants more features, developers will advice on time and budget. If the client wants to pay the extra charge. The developers will advice on this and maybe even suggest removal of some faetutes the client doesn't like so much to save on time.
 
 Everybody's happy at the end.
 
 
 
 Agile Development in theory will result in a better product since everyone was continously contributing and wworking together.
 
 
 For agile to work, we need honest devs, a smart engaged client with a tollerance for the unknown.
